# Module wise Keywords üóùÔ∏è of 5G network:-

## [Module - 1]()
 1.**cellular networking**

  It's a mobile-based network used with a radio antenna. These devices are associated with ‚Äúcell‚Äùs and can move from cell to cell in order to communicate and maintain communication.

 2.**Network generation**

 A network generation is a type of   cellular network generally referred to by its number, starting with 1G and going all the way through 2G, 3G, and 4G to the most recent developed generation: 5G.

 
 3.**Digital voice** 

It works by using something called a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). It converts your voice into a digital signal so it can be sent between devices over the internet.


 4.**Carrier waves and light waves**
    
   *carrier waves* 
    
   carrier wave is the continuous electromagnetic radiation,  of constant amplitude and frequency, that is given out by a transmitter
    
   *light waves*
    
 In telecommunications, visible light communication (VLC) is the use of visible light (light with a frequency of 400‚Äì800 THz/wavelength of 780‚Äì375 nm) as a transmission medium. VLC is a subset of optical wireless communications technologies.



5. **wireles transmission**

Wireless communications is the transmission of voice and data without cable or wires. In place of a physical connection, data travels through electromagnetic signals broadcast from sending facilities to intermediate and end-user devices.



6.**Noise and interference**

Noise refers to any energy interference that degrades the quality of a wireless signal. Noise can affect everything from radio transmissions to network speeds. 



7.**Radio spectrum**

The longest waves on the electromagnetic spectrum--radio waves--carry information from a station to a receiver. But radio waves don't carry information all by themselves. They need to be altered, or modulated. A signal--a transverse sound wave--overlays the carrier wave, forcing it to change



8.**Radio channel**

Every user of radio spectrum needs a ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù or block of pipelines in order to communicate over. These pipelines are called channels and they are differentiated by their frequency. 
    
    
    
9.**Data pipe**

A data pipeline is a method in which raw data is ingested from various data sources and then ported to data store, like a data lake or data warehouse, for analysis. Before data flows into a data repository, it usually undergoes some data processing.

10.**whats Fdd and ,Tdd**
  
   *Fdd :-* 
   
  Frequency-division  duplexing (FDD)  is a method for establishing a full-  duplex communications link that uses two different radio frequencies for transmitter and receiver operation.

  
      
   *Tdd:-*
   
   Time division duplex (TDD) refers to duplex communication where uplink is separated from downlink by the allocation of different time slots in the same frequency band.

   **Difference b/w FDD and TDD**

11.**The celluelar concept**

Cellular Concepts refers to the use of a group of cells to provide communication from one place to another place when the user is mobile. A cellular system in mobile computing implements space division multiplexing or SDM. Each transmitter in the cellular system is called a base station.

  *eMBB:-* 
  Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), also known as extreme mobile broadband, is one of the three defining characteristics of 5G‚Äîthe other two being massive capacity and ultra-low latency.

  *m -MTC:-*
  
  5G mMTC. The service category called massive machine-type communication (mMTC) supports massive device connectivity in IoT applications. 5G mMTC uses non-human-type communication models that prioritize low-rate, uplink-centric transmission.

  *URLLC:-*
  
  URLLC is one of the main features that makes 5G a better performer than 4G. It guarantees faster and richer services as the lower latency allows a network to process large amounts of data with minimal delay.

Strong mmWave detection capability and good security.

- Broadband and broad-spectrum capabilities can be used to suppress multipath effects and clutter echoes. There are a large number of frequencies available to effectively eliminate mutual interference.

- .High millimeter wave transmission quality, small component size and all-weather communication Because there are basically no interference sources in high-frequency millimeter wave communications, and the electromagnetic spectrum is extremely clean, the millimeter wave channel is very stable and reliable, and its bit error rate can be maintained at the order of 10-12 for a long time, which is comparable to the transmission quality of optical cables.



***Disadvantages of mmWave***

- Devices equipped to use the millimeter frequency specification would also suffer from intensive power consumption,especially when connected to the fifth-generation network

- Deploying mmWave 5G networks is fundamentally more expensive than deploying 5G networks based on the sub-6 GHz specification because of the need to place several smaller cells in strategic locations to ensure maximum coverage. Compatibility is another drawback
