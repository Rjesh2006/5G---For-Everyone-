 ## General questions about 5G network##

  1.*whats 5G network*

5G is the fifth generation of wireless cellular technology, offering higher upload and download speeds, more consistent connections, and improved capacity than previous networks.


  2.*Why 5G Network is needed ?*

The main advantages of the 5G are a greater speed in the transmissions, a lower latency and therefore greater capacity of remote execution, a greater number of connected devices and the possibility of implementing virtual networks (network slicing), providing more adjusted connectivity to concrete needs.


  3.*difference b/w 4G and 5G*



# Module wise Keywords üóùÔ∏è of 5G network:-#

## Module -1
 1.**cellular networking**

  It's a mobile-based network used with a radio antenna. These devices are associated with ‚Äúcell‚Äùs and can move from cell to cell in order to communicate and maintain communication.

 2.**Network generation**

 A network generation is a type of   cellular network generally referred to by its number, starting with 1G and going all the way through 2G, 3G, and 4G to the most recent developed generation: 5G.

 
 3.**Digital voice**

It works by using something called a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). It converts your voice into a digital signal so it can be sent between devices over the internet.


 4.**Carrier waves and light waves**
    
    *carrier waves* 
    
    carrier wave is the continuous electromagnetic radiation,  of constant amplitude and frequency, that is given out by a transmitter
    
    *light waves*
    
    In telecommunications, visible light communication (VLC) is the use of visible light (light with a frequency of 400‚Äì800 THz/wavelength of 780‚Äì375 nm) as a transmission medium. VLC is a subset of optical wireless communications technologies.



5. **wireles transmission**

   Wireless communications is the transmission of voice and data without cable or wires. In place of a physical connection, data travels through electromagnetic signals broadcast from sending facilities to intermediate and end-user devices.



6.**Noise and interference**

Noise refers to any energy interference that degrades the quality of a wireless signal. Noise can affect everything from radio transmissions to network speeds. 



7.**Radio spectrum**

The longest waves on the electromagnetic spectrum--radio waves--carry information from a station to a receiver. But radio waves don't carry information all by themselves. They need to be altered, or modulated. A signal--a transverse sound wave--overlays the carrier wave, forcing it to change



8.**Radio channel**

Every user of radio spectrum needs a ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù or block of pipelines in order to communicate over. These pipelines are called channels and they are differentiated by their frequency. 
    
    
    
9.**Data pipe**

A data pipeline is a method in which raw data is ingested from various data sources and then ported to data store, like a data lake or data warehouse, for analysis. Before data flows into a data repository, it usually undergoes some data processing.
