 ## General questions about 5G network##

  1.*whats 5G network*

5G is the fifth generation of wireless cellular technology, offering higher upload and download speeds, more consistent connections, and improved capacity than previous networks.


  2.*Why 5G Network is needed ?*

The main advantages of the 5G are a greater speed in the transmissions, a lower latency and therefore greater capacity of remote execution, a greater number of connected devices and the possibility of implementing virtual networks (network slicing), providing more adjusted connectivity to concrete needs.


  3.*difference b/w 4G and 5G*



# Module wise Keywords üóùÔ∏è of 5G network:-

## Module - 1
 1.**cellular networking**

  It's a mobile-based network used with a radio antenna. These devices are associated with ‚Äúcell‚Äùs and can move from cell to cell in order to communicate and maintain communication.

 2.**Network generation**

 A network generation is a type of   cellular network generally referred to by its number, starting with 1G and going all the way through 2G, 3G, and 4G to the most recent developed generation: 5G.

 
 3.**Digital voice**

It works by using something called a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). It converts your voice into a digital signal so it can be sent between devices over the internet.


 4.**Carrier waves and light waves**
    
    *carrier waves* 
    
    carrier wave is the continuous electromagnetic radiation,  of constant amplitude and frequency, that is given out by a transmitter
    
    *light waves*
    
 In telecommunications, visible light communication (VLC) is the use of visible light (light with a frequency of 400‚Äì800 THz/wavelength of 780‚Äì375 nm) as a transmission medium. VLC is a subset of optical wireless communications technologies.



5. **wireles transmission**

Wireless communications is the transmission of voice and data without cable or wires. In place of a physical connection, data travels through electromagnetic signals broadcast from sending facilities to intermediate and end-user devices.



6.**Noise and interference**

Noise refers to any energy interference that degrades the quality of a wireless signal. Noise can affect everything from radio transmissions to network speeds. 



7.**Radio spectrum**

The longest waves on the electromagnetic spectrum--radio waves--carry information from a station to a receiver. But radio waves don't carry information all by themselves. They need to be altered, or modulated. A signal--a transverse sound wave--overlays the carrier wave, forcing it to change



8.**Radio channel**

Every user of radio spectrum needs a ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù or block of pipelines in order to communicate over. These pipelines are called channels and they are differentiated by their frequency. 
    
    
    
9.**Data pipe**

A data pipeline is a method in which raw data is ingested from various data sources and then ported to data store, like a data lake or data warehouse, for analysis. Before data flows into a data repository, it usually undergoes some data processing.

10.**whats Fdd and ,Tdd**
  
   *Fdd :-* 
   
  Frequency-division  duplexing (FDD)  is a method for establishing a full-  duplex communications link that uses two different radio frequencies for transmitter and receiver operation.

  
      
   *Tdd:-*
   
   Time division duplex (TDD) refers to duplex communication where uplink is separated from downlink by the allocation of different time slots in the same frequency band.

   **Difference b/w FDD and TDD**

11.**The celluelar concept**

Cellular Concepts refers to the use of a group of cells to provide communication from one place to another place when the user is mobile. A cellular system in mobile computing implements space division multiplexing or SDM. Each transmitter in the cellular system is called a base station.

12.**5G-NR**

5G New Radio (NR) is the global standard for a unified, more capable 5G wireless air interface. It is delivering significantly faster and more responsive mobile experiences.


13.**5G - NR classes**

  *eMBB:-* 
  Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), also known as extreme mobile broadband, is one of the three defining characteristics of 5G‚Äîthe other two being massive capacity and ultra-low latency.

  *m -MTC:-*
  
  5G mMTC. The service category called massive machine-type communication (mMTC) supports massive device connectivity in IoT applications. 5G mMTC uses non-human-type communication models that prioritize low-rate, uplink-centric transmission.

  *URLLC:-*
  
  URLLC is one of the main features that makes 5G a better performer than 4G. It guarantees faster and richer services as the lower latency allows a network to process large amounts of data with minimal delay.

# 5G Network and Features

1.**5G - NR Neteork architecture**

The fifth generation mobile network is a new global wireless standard after 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G networks delivering up to 20 Gigabits-per-second (Gbps) peak data rates and 100+ Megabits-per-second (Mbps) average data rates. 5G will use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) encoding bonded up to between 100 and 800 MHz channels.

The evolution of the mobile world is not all that 5G is, therefore the breadth of 5G extends beyond mobile communication to address all forms of communication services; in fact, it is truly supporting the future of the digital world by enabling all types of services, including critical/non-critical, voice/non-voice, and IoT. Promoting economic change across all sectors and utilizing all diverse technologies ( WiFi, 4G, and new radio technologies).

2.**Flexible slot based framework**

the  flexible slot based frame works is used to allows network operators to efficiently multiplex the envisioned 5G services on the same frequency. A key technology to deliver this flexible framework is the 5G NR self- contained slot structure.

4.**Channel ciding in 5G**

For fifth generation (5G), two different channel coding techniques have been chosen by third generation partnership project for error-free data transmission. In the 5G standard, the data and control channels use low-density parity check (LDPC) and polar codes, respectively, due to their
